# Diabetes-Prediction-InternPe
Completed task-1 of [AI/ML] as a part of internship at InternPe i.e-Diabetes Prediction Using ML

-This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using machine learning techniques.
-It utilizes a dataset containing various health-related features to train predictive models.
-Explored several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost classifier for predicting diabetes risk.
-Among these, SVM emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy score of 0.77 on the test dataset.
